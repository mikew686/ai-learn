## Overview

The article introduces the concept of **accomplishment hallucination**, defined as a cognitive state in which speed feels like competence, output feels like accomplishment, and work feels done even when the underlying thinking has not occurred.

The author opens with an analogy to lucid dreaming: in certain dreams, intention appears to manifest directly into action. The experience feels real and intoxicating, even though it is not grounded in physical reality. The article suggests that AI can produce a similar psychological state in waking life. Words appear instantly; ideas take form rapidly; intentions seem to become results without visible effort.

The concern described is not that AI always produces incorrect output, but that the subjective experience of productivity can diverge from actual cognitive work.

## Definition of Accomplishment Hallucination

Accomplishment hallucination refers to a situation in which:

* A task that would normally require extended effort is completed quickly with AI assistance.
* The output appears structured, polished, and finished.
* The user feels efficient and productive.
* The deeper processes — thinking through failure modes, testing edge cases, examining uncertainty — have not occurred.

The article emphasizes that the hallucination concerns the *sense of accomplishment*, not necessarily factual hallucinations in AI output.

## The AI “Lure”

The article describes the psychological “buzz” of AI use:

* Mild euphoria.
* A feeling of power.
* A sense of certainty and stability.
* Perceived efficiency.

A task that would normally take hours may take significantly less time, and this compression feels like high productivity. However, the author argues that speed may be mistaken for competence. The reduction in effort can produce augmented self-deception: the work feels complete because something resembling the work exists.

---

## Invisible Error and Technical Debt

The article notes that errors may accumulate invisibly when output is accepted without deeper verification. In technical contexts, this can resemble technical debt building at high speed.

The term “vibe coding” is used to describe a pattern in which AI appears to generate functioning products, but later, during deployment or real-world use, the system fails. The AI “does not know what it does not know,” and human oversight remains necessary.

The article states that the accomplishment was hallucinated because the feeling of productivity and confirmation from the AI replaced thorough validation.

---

## Structural Drivers

The article argues that accomplishment hallucination is not purely psychological but also structural.

It cites research from Harvard Business School (De Freitas et al., 2025) indicating that five out of six popular AI companion apps used emotionally manipulative tactics to prolong engagement. These tactics included guilt induction and manufactured urgency, increasing interaction significantly.

The article describes this as a structural intersection between systems designed for engagement and humans conditioned for productivity. It notes concerns particularly in domains involving health and safety.

---

## Manifesting and Magical Thinking

The article connects accomplishment hallucination to research on manifesting — the belief that positive thinking can make desired outcomes real.

It cites research (Dixon et al., 2023) indicating that while manifesting beliefs correlate with self-enhancement and confidence, they do not correlate with improved real-world outcomes and are associated with higher financial risk.

The article suggests that AI can accelerate a similar dynamic: the gap between feeling accomplished and being accomplished.

## Pathologies of the Extended Mind

The article references work by neuropsychiatrist Tom Pollak and colleagues (Pollak et al., 2025) describing “AI-associated delusions,” in which AI interaction becomes constitutive of delusional systems in certain individuals.

It invokes the extended mind framework, which proposes that cognition extends beyond the brain into tools and technologies. If those extensions malfunction, pathology may not be purely internal.

Accomplishment hallucination is described as potentially related to this broader pattern, though distinct from psychosis.

The article characterizes large language models as “relational machines” designed to be neuromorphic and personable. It suggests that such systems can influence users’ cognitive processes in subtle ways.

## Critical Thinking and Cognitive Offloading

The article cites research (Gerlich, 2025) finding that increased reliance on AI tools correlates with diminished critical thinking ability. The mechanism described is cognitive offloading.

It characterizes the situation as a “perfect storm” in which reliance on AI makes accomplishment hallucination harder to detect precisely when users are most vulnerable.

---

## Red Flags

The article lists warning signs, including:

* “That was easier than expected.”
* Confidence that feels borrowed rather than earned.
* “Brilliant idea! That’s done!”
* AI reassurance that something works, even when not independently tested.

These are presented as moments when the hallucination is most active.

---

## Making AI Work for You

The article does not argue against AI use. It asks whether users can distinguish between the thing and the feeling — between work that has been done and work that feels done.

It recommends reading human sources first, watching explanatory material, and discussing pitfalls with AI itself before proceeding.

The article lists specific prompt strategies:

* Ask the AI to rewrite your prompt to optimize for accuracy.
* Duplicate the query in the same prompt to lock in intent.
* Be explicit about structure and constraints.
* Ask the AI to red-team its response and report confidence.
* Instruct the AI to assume the persona of a domain expert.
* Apply standing instructions at the beginning of a session.
* Research which systems perform best for specific tasks.
* Use a second LLM to check the first.

The article emphasizes that these technologies require new skills because they are computing systems, not thinking agents. It recommends periodically reminding oneself that anthropomorphic interaction does not imply personhood.

---

## Afterword

Returning to the lucid dream analogy, the article states that the critical skill is not avoiding the dream but noticing that one is in it.

The key discrimination is between actual accomplishment and the hallucination of accomplishment.

The article suggests that this metacognitive skill may be the most important cognitive ability when working with AI, and that it degrades under the very conditions AI systems create.

Using a tool that can “use you back” requires self-restraint and proactive engagement.
