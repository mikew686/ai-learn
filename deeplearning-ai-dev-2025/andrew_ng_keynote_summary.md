# Andrew Ng — Opening Keynote Summary
### DeepLearning.AI Dev Convention 2025 — NYC
### Integrated Summary (Notes + interpretations + slide content)

---

**Andrew Ng, Founder of DeepLearning.AI, Co-founder of Coursera, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University, delivered the opening keynote of the DeepLearning.AI Dev Convention 2025.** His presentation framed the central questions of the convention by examining the rapid acceleration of AI capabilities, the disruption of traditional software-development workflows, and the widening gap between technical progress and public trust. Ng's keynote established rapid iteration, shifting bottlenecks, and the changing role of engineers as recurring themes throughout the convention, setting a foundation of cautious optimism: while AI capabilities are skyrocketing, the human and organizational structures around them have not yet caught up.

## 1. AI Progress Is Accelerating Faster Than Expected
- Long-horizon AI task capability is **doubling every ~7 months**.
- AI coding capability is doubling roughly every **70 days**.
- Tasks such as answering questions, retrieving facts, and training models have expanded dramatically from GPT-2 → GPT-3 → present.
- Implication:
  - AI systems are rapidly increasing in capability.
  - Software built on them is becoming more powerful.
  - Engineering workflows themselves are being transformed by AI coding.

---

## 2. Prototype Development Is Now 10× Faster — Production Only 1.5×
- Prototypes built with AI coding are **~10× faster**.
- Writing or maintaining production-grade software is **only ~1.5× faster**.
- Prototyping is now near-zero cost compared to production.
- Teams should generate **10–20 prototypes per cycle**.
- Updated cultural guidance: **Move fast and be responsible.**

---

## 3. The New Development Loop: Explore First, Define Later
Traditional loop:
**Define → Build → Validate → Iterate**

AI-era loop:
**Build many prototypes → Filter quickly → Validate with users → Scale winners**

- Requirements increasingly emerge **after exploration**, not before.
- Product discovery shifts from prediction to experimentation.

---

## 4. Product Management Is the New Bottleneck
Slide: **“Building at speed: The Product Management Bottleneck.”**

- Engineering is now extremely fast due to AI coding.
- PM-led steps (feedback, requirements, validation) constrain iteration.
- Loop visual highlights:
  - **Build (Software Engineering)** — accelerated
  - **Get Feedback (PM)** — new bottleneck
  - **Prototype** — central unit of iteration
- Engineer:PM ratios trending toward **1:1**.
- Engineers who shape product direction dramatically accelerate teams.

---

## 5. Public Trust in AI Is Low — and Slipping
Slide: **“AI has not won America’s hearts and minds.”**

- Pew Research data (2021–2025):
  - “More concerned than excited” peaks at **52%** (2023).
  - Still high at **50%** in 2025.
  - “More excited than concerned” remains low at **16%** in 2025.
- International comparison: concern lower at 34%.
- Fear-based narratives dominate public discourse.

---

## 6. Workers Want AI — But Only for Certain Tasks
Slide: **“America wants AI.”**

Workers want AI to automate **46.1%** of tasks on average.

### High desire for automation
- Tax Preparer – Scheduling appointments (5.0 stars)
- 911 Operator – Maintaining call logs (4.7 stars)
- Timekeeping Clerk – Payment corrections (4.6 stars)

### Low desire for automation
- Editors – Writing stories (1.6 stars)
- Ticket Agents – Helping find lost items (1.5 stars)
- Logistics Analysts – Vendor communication (1.5 stars)

### Reasons workers want automation
- Frees time for high-value work — **69.4%**
- Task is repetitive/tedious — **46.6%**
- Automation improves quality — **46.6%**
- Task is stressful — **25.5%**
- Task is complicated — **18.9%**

Workers embrace AI when it removes **drudgery**, but resist when it threatens identity or craftsmanship.

## 7. Evaluation Is Becoming the New Technical Bottleneck
- Human evaluation does not scale with model output volume.
- Need for:
  - Automated scoring
  - Rubric-based evaluation
  - Synthetic test generation
  - Evaluation-focused engineering roles (“Evaluation Ops”)
- Evaluation velocity now determines product velocity.

---

## 8. Agentic Systems Are Improving but Still Unreliable
Agents increasingly handle:
- Tool use
- Retrieval
- Multi-step planning
- Autonomous decision loops

But reliability remains the primary blocker:
- Enterprises need predictable, guardrailed behavior.
- Safety and control are required for real adoption.

---

## 9. Data Strategy Is Now a Critical Differentiator
AI value shifting from generic large datasets to:
- Domain-specific datasets
- Expert-curated instruction data
- Organization-specific operational data

Best-performing systems combine:
- Foundation models
- High-quality proprietary data
- Golden evaluation sets

---

## 10. Cost Dynamics Are Changing
- Inference costs dropping faster than expected.
- Engineering cost now often exceeds compute cost.
- Enables:
  - More prototypes
  - More evaluation
  - Rapid iteration at lower risk

---

## 11. Engineers Must Upskill to Stay Effective
New AI-era engineering skills:
- Prompt engineering patterns
- Data curation
- Evaluation design
- Debugging LLM-driven behavior
- Safety/guardrail design

Engineers mastering hybrid AI–software skills become force multipliers.

---

## 12. Organizational Structures Are Adapting to AI
Expected shifts:
- Cross-functional AI teams
- ML engineers embedded within product teams
- Closer alignment between PM, engineering, and domain experts

New roles include:
- Data Quality Owner
- Evaluation Engineer
- AI Operations

AI reshapes not just workflows but team structures.

---

## 13. Enterprise Deployment Lessons
Successful deployments:
- Narrow, clearly-defined scope
- Strong evaluation loops
- Worker-aligned design
- High-quality domain data
- Clear ROI

Failure patterns:
- Overly broad objectives
- Weak evaluation
- Ignoring user/worker sentiment
- Underinvestment in iteration and data

**Small wins compound quickly.**

---

## 14. Final Takeaways
- AI progress is accelerating across capabilities and coding workflows.
- Bottlenecks have shifted from engineering → PM, evaluation, and perception.
- Workers embrace AI that removes busywork but resist AI that challenges identity.
- Organizations win by:
  - Prototyping aggressively
  - Evaluating rigorously
  - Investing in data quality
  - Designing AI that enhances human agency
  - Communicating responsibly
